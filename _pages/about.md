I am a second-year PhD candidate majored in statistics at Boston University. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Konstantinos Spiliopoulos](https://math.bu.edu/people/kspiliop/) and Prof. [Samuel Isaacson](https://math.bu.edu/people/isaacson/). My research interests encompass mathematical biology, numerical analysis, stochastic processes, partial and ordinary differential equations (PDEs/ODEs), and machine learning. 

Prior to joining Boston University, I received my master's degree in applied mathematics from University of California, San Diego, and my bachelor's degree in applied mathematics from Nankai University, Tianjin, China. I also visited University of California, Berkeley as a visiting student during my undergraduate.
